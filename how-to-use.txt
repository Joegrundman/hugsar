Hello
=====

Here there will be the guidelines for managing the site

there are only three files and one folder you will need to deal with often

the most important file is: 


_config.yml
===========

This contains almost all the setup, background images, quite a lot of the text

When making changes you need to stick to the format exactly

Also changes to this file won't appear until you restart the jekyll server

about.html
==========
this contains the text that will appear in the about box. You may change it at will and
format it as you like. It's an html file, but also accepts Markdown formatting


contact.html
============
this contains your contact info. 

_posts
======

this folder is how you make new blog posts

it's very simple.

To make a new post you simply make a new file in this folder. It must first have the date
 in the filename. The date must be correctly formatted. This is how the blog sorts the order
  of your posts. Then comes the title of the post, and lastly the format type. The jekyll engine
  does the rest.
  
  the filename format is:
  
  YYYY-MM-DD-my-blog-post-name.md
  
  (.md is for markdown format)
  
  Your blog posts can be handled using any of three languages. Markdown, textile, liquid.
  
  markdown is the one that I recommend.  It is an extremely easy and brilliant formatting
   system, based on how people naturally format emails. It takes minutes to learn.
  
  i made a markdown previewer, which you can use to see how it will look 
  (and there are lots of better ones out there). But the actual .md 
  text can just be sent as an email, not even as an attachment
